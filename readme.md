# Environmental Air Quality Monitoring

This is a solution that showcases how State & Local Government's can monitor environmental air quality with:
- A **Raspberry Pi Pico W**, serving as an IoT device, that collects air quality data via an **ENS-160** and **DHT-22** sensor
- A **Power Automate** flow that receives this data from the Raspberry Pi via an HTTP POST request trigger
- A **Dataverse** table that the Power Automate flow places the data into, using several *Formula columns*
- A **Power Apps** Model-Driven App to display collected Air Quality Reading Data
- A **Power BI** dashboard that reports air quality data and trends in a visual report, reading directly from Dataverse.

## 3D-Printed Assets
The Raspberry Pi IoT device lives neatly in a 3D-printed housing. You can find the source files (.STL) files of the housing and print yourself [on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6655576).

## Calculating Absolute Humidity from Relative Humidity and Temperature
All formulas, from [here](https://carnotcycle.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/how-to-convert-relative-humidity-to-absolute-humidity/):

Temperature is in Celsius, Relative Humidity as a percentage.

You can express the formula above as a Dataverse Formula column like so:
```
(6.112 * (2.71828^((17.67*(('Temperature, Fahrenheit'-32)*(5/9)))/((('Temperature, Fahrenheit'-32)*(5/9))+243.5))) * 'Relative Humidity' * 2.1674) / (273.15 + (('Temperature, Fahrenheit'-32)*(5/9)))
```
## Power BI Expression for Converting to EST
To convert the `createdon` field (stored in UTC time) to EST:

```
[createdon] - #duration(0, 4, 0, 0)
```
