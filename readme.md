# Environmental Air Quality Monitoring
![AQM](https://i.imgur.com/MviktuE.png)
This is a solution that showcases how State & Local Government's can monitor environmental air quality with:
- A **Raspberry Pi Pico W**, serving as an IoT device, that collects air quality data via an **ENS-160** and **DHT-22** sensor
- A **Power Automate** flow that receives this data from the Raspberry Pi via an HTTP POST request trigger
- A **Dataverse** table that the Power Automate flow places the data into, using several *Formula columns*
- A **Power Apps** Model-Driven App to display collected Air Quality Reading Data
- A **Power BI** dashboard that reports air quality data and trends in a visual report, reading directly from Dataverse.

## Assets
We're providing the following assets so you can replicate this project as well:
- The source code (written in MicroPython) that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico W can be found in the [`src` folder](./src/)
- The Raspberry Pi IoT device lives neatly in a 3D-printed housing. You can find the source files (.STL) files of the housing and print yourself [on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6655576).

## How to Calculate Absolute Humidity from Relative Humidity and Temperature
In this project, we calculate *absolute* humidity from the *relative humidity* and *temperature* readings our IoT device samples and transmits. Below is the equation for calculating absolute humidity. We use this equation in our Dataverse **Formula** column.

Temperature is in Celsius, Relative Humidity as a percentage.

You can express the formula above as a Dataverse Formula column like so:
```
(6.112 * (2.71828^((17.67*(('Temperature, Fahrenheit'-32)*(5/9)))/((('Temperature, Fahrenheit'-32)*(5/9))+243.5))) * 'Relative Humidity' * 2.1674) / (273.15 + (('Temperature, Fahrenheit'-32)*(5/9)))
```

## Power BI Expression for Converting to EST
To convert the `createdon` field (stored in UTC time) to EST:

```
[createdon] - #duration(0, 4, 0, 0)
```
